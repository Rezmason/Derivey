Adaptive curve smoothness

  Write a coarse function that implements the current sampling behavior
    Only use this when curveSegments is specified

  Write a new function that takes a path, a start, an end, a maxDist and a minAngle
    If the path is not curved, just use the coarse function

    Start with coarse samples of the curve
      For every sample,
        Grab the two successive samples: s0, s1, s2 (looping around)
        If (
          distance(s0.p, s2.p) > maxDist ||
          distance(s0.q, s2.q) > maxDist ||
          abs(angle(s0.p, s1.p, s2.p)) < minAngle ||
          abs(angle(s0.q, s1.q, s2.q)) < minAngle
        ) {
          insert a sample between s0 and s1
          insert a sample between s1 and s2
        }
      Do this until there are no insertions.

  Rewrite:
    expandShapePath
    renderSolidLine

  Right now, everything is a bunch of meshes with lines in them
  What if there was a way to compose objects and then repeat them?

Portable Drivey
  Like A-Frame, drivey.js (and minified) would find a root tag in the DOM and render it
  browserify / webpack / rollup
    Gotta prune, jeez
