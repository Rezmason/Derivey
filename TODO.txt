Why doesn't it run on iPads?

Level-specified lanes
  Each level gets to specify how many lanes there are and how wide they are
  Each car gets assigned a random lane, and NPC cars get a "human error" offset
  Auto-steer picks the closest lane
    Detect when car has crossed the divider, and flip it around

Replace framerate gauge with simulated RPM
  Prevent moving in reverse on when on auto-pilot
  Simluated gearbox?

Prevent scrolling issue on mobile

Much, much later
  Spotify playlist embed?
