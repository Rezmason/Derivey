    Is the level smaller, or is the camera zoomed in?

Menu
    Text links, at first, in a div on top of the canvas
    On and off states
    Switch to SVG icons

Car mesh
    Make one yourself, man
    Add headlights
    Add tail lights

Pretty sure the FOV needs revisiting again

Color contrast stuff
wireframe support
    White on blue
Doesn't have to be as pretty

Collision
    "theWalls" in jj

Editorial
    Readability pass
    Run prettier, eslint
    Reshape Drivey class to conform to Jujuscript code







Much, much later

    Road path approximation data structure improvement

    Optimization

        Stop instantiating vectors in computations
            optionalTarget model
            Helper function "return optionalTarget || new THREE.Vector2" etc

        Use the profiler to find bottlenecks

        Replace ExtrusionBufferGeometry and ShapeBufferGeometry with something custom?
            Almost all road lines are *ribbons*

    Am I doing splines right?
