Three.js

    Just... fuck forms
        Box up whatever Playground does
        Make levels based on that
            Level
            DeepDarkNight
            Tunnel
            City
            IndustrialZone

    They say to merge all the geometry you can
        Use just one material, then store brightness values on vertices
        Backgrounds, meshes that don't move but have the same material

    Port car logic
        Just stick a box around them for now
        Replace bogus car data with real data
        Speedometers
    Left-right lane switch

    Color stuff
        Background tinting
            That sky-low, sky-high stuff

    Car mesh
        Make one yourself, man
        Add headlights
        Add tail lights

    White on blue wireframe support
        Doesn't have to be as pretty

Javascript prep
    Replace operators with method calls
    Replace abstracts if you haven't already

Javascript
    from Haxe, by hand

Reshape it to conform to Jujuscript code

Optimization
    Use the profiler to find bottlenecks

Am I doing splines right?
