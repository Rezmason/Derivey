Three.js

    Form should use ShapePath

    Merging is more complicated than it seemed
        If two forms specify a height, does merging them preserve that difference? What about color?
        Can a form specify no color, so that it's inherited from a parent?

    Playground
        Place objects on road
            Lampposts are placed on road at offset
        Car
            Scaled extruded unit squares
            headlights
            tail lights
        Dashboard
            Attached to camera
        Gradient skybox
            Attached to camera
        Tinted background

    Build scene graph once
        Other cars are cloned from car template

    They say to merge all the geometry you can
        Backgrounds, meshes that don't move but have the same material

    Camera
        Replace all that projection stuff
        Plug into tilt,pitch,zoom
    Screen stuff
        Everything besides skybox is a tinted solid color
            Screen RGB and alpha properties on Screen are unnecessary
        White on blue wireframe support
            Doesn't have to be as pretty

Javascript prep
    Replace operators with method calls
    Replace abstracts if you haven't already

Javascript
    from Haxe, by hand

Optimization
    Use the profiler to find bottlenecks

Am I doing splines right?
