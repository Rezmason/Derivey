Declarative level representation
  HTML, actually. Gonna load it up like A-Frame
  let parser = new DOMParser();
  let doc = parser.parseFromString(htmlSource, "text/html");

  Easiest to hardest:
    Simple: DeepDarkNight, CliffsideBeach, TestLevel, Overpass
    Loop: Tunnel, WarpGate
    Rows: Spectre
    Sky: TrainTracks
    Buildings: City
    Just a lot going on: IndustrialZone

Portable Drivey
  Like A-Frame, drivey.js (and minified) would find a root tag in the DOM and render it
  browserify / webpack / rollup
    Gotta prune, jeez
