Three.js

    Just... fuck forms
        Box up whatever Playground does
        Make levels based on that
            City
            IndustrialZone

    Camera FOV needs fixing

    They say to merge all the geometry you can
        Use just one material, then store brightness values on vertices
        Backgrounds, meshes that don't move but have the same material

    Port car logic
        Just stick a box around them for now
        Replace bogus car data with real data
        Speedometers
        Manual and auto
            Left and right arrow keys
            Up and down arrow keys

    Left-right lane switch
        Switch cars' lanes, animate dashboard position shift
            Really ease dashboard
    Handbrake
        should make you slow to a stop on YOUR SIDE OF THE ROAD

    Color stuff
        Object coloration
        Level tint, high, low, ground
            Background tinting


    Car mesh
        Make one yourself, man
        Add headlights
        Add tail lights

    wireframe support
        White on blue
    Doesn't have to be as pretty

Javascript prep
    Replace operators with method calls
    Replace abstracts if you haven't already

Javascript
    from Haxe, by hand

Reshape it to conform to Jujuscript code

Optimization
    Use the profiler to find bottlenecks

Am I doing splines right?
