Separate "solid" into "smooth" and "angular"
  "smooth" and "dashed" will be smoothly approximated, ie have no declared spacing
  "pointy" will have a spacing parameter (instead of "point-spacing")

Adaptive curve smoothness

  2D spline extrusion

    Get the beginning, middle, and end samples
    const isStraightLine = samples have same tangent and their positions sit on a straight line
    if (isStraightLine) {
      return [start, end].map(({pos}) => pos);
    }

    const maxDistSquared = maxDist ** 2;
    Get coarse samples of the curve
    let iterate = true;
    let samples = [ start, (start + middle) / 2, end ];
    while (iterate) {
      iterate = false;
      for (every sample) {
        Grab the successive sample: s0, s1 (looping around)
        If (distanceSquared(s0.point, s1.point) > maxDist || abs(s0.angle  - s1.angle)) < maxAngle) {
          insert a sample between s0 and s1;
          iterate = true;
        }
      }
    }

    return samples.map(({pos}) => pos);

  curveSegments of ExtrudeBufferGeometry
    How do different shapes get extruded?
      CurvePath::getPoints. Not great.
    What we want is for all paths at this point to be polygonal, and to be extruded "verbatim"
      Every function that makes a path, should make a polygon path

Remake dashboard from smooth curves

HTML revision
  Right now, everything is a bunch of meshes with lines in them
  What if there was a way to compose objects and then repeat them?

Portable Drivey
  Like A-Frame, drivey.js (and minified) would find a root tag in the DOM and render it
  browserify / webpack / rollup
    Gotta prune, jeez

Why doesn't it run on iPads?

Change car auto-steering logic when the car is going in reverse

Replace framerate gauge with simulated RPM
  Prevent moving in reverse on when on auto-pilot
  Simluated gearbox?

Improve performance of Approximation::getNearest

Cavern level
  Stalagmites and stalagtites, subtle color variation?
