Auto steering

New levels
    Cliffside
        Teal
        Ground is ocean
        Use tarmac to create ground
        Create cliff top on left, cliff on right
            Alternate colors to give rocky appearance

Menu
    Text links, at first, in a div on top of the canvas
    On and off states
    Switch to SVG icons

Left-right lane switch
    Switch cars' lanes, animate dashboard position shift
        Really ease dashboard
Handbrake
    should make you slow to a stop on YOUR SIDE OF THE ROAD

Car mesh
    Make one yourself, man
    Add headlights
    Add tail lights

Pretty sure the FOV needs revisiting again

Color contrast stuff
wireframe support
    White on blue
Doesn't have to be as pretty

Collision
    "theWalls" in jj

Editorial
    Readability pass
    Reshape Drivey class to conform to Jujuscript code







Much, much later

    Optimization

        Stop instantiating vectors in computations
            optionalTarget model
            Helper function "return optionalTarget || new THREE.Vector2" etc

        Use the profiler to find bottlenecks

        Replace ExtrusionBufferGeometry and ShapeBufferGeometry with something custom?
            Almost all road lines are *ribbons*

    Am I doing splines right?
